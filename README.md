# Symphony-MP3-Music-Player---Python-Project
Introducing an mp3 music player "SYMPHONY" , made using Python language.<br>

Symphony takes input of any folder using the browse music button and picks only mp3 files. It places them in the playlist, from where one can select one among the pool of mp3 files and use the following listed features:<br>
play, 
pause,
fast forward (5 seconds ahead),
fast backward (5 seconds back),
scale for moving song position from any one time instant to another,
next song ,
previous song ,
Volume control (both scaled control and button control for minor volume up and down).<br>

Following Libraries were used in it's making:
Tkinter,
time,
os,
pillow,
pygame,
mutagen.<br>

For adding some visual appeal, a gif has been inserted which will continuously play until the window is closed.
